## Converting the grey values to the number of electrons
To convert the electron value given by each pixel to the number of photons received in each pixel.

Number of electrons = (Grey value - Bias)*Gain

## Converting the number of electrons to photon flux
Number of photons = Number of electrons/QE in decimal

QE for 647nm wavelength for Prime BSI Express camera is 90%.

## BIAS Measurements
Number of photons = Signal in Electrons/QE in decimal

## GAIN Measurements

## Read noise calculations

## Signal to noise ratio calculations

   
## FAQs: 
**What specifications from the camera manufacturer are required?**
